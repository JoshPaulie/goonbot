## Wow, no invite?
Sends a tongue-in-cheek message conveying you wish you were invited to *whatever you've been left out from*. It randomly picks from a list of snarky comments.

## Where is everybody?
Used to "nudge" chat, broadcasting a user is free for games or VC. The response is influenced by the day of week and time of day.

The time of day is determined as follows:
- 12AM to 3AM is considered the previous day's night.
    - For example, 2AM on a Sunday is treated as Saturday night.
- 4AM to 11AM is considered morning.
- 12PM to 5PM is considered afternoon.
- 6PM to 11:59PM is considered night.
