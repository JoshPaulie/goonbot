# Pics
Simply sends a pic realted to the command name. Many (if not all) of the images are hand curated by community member, Ectoplax.

## Rat & Cat
Sends an image of a rat or cat

## Real
Sends an evidence of the paranormal. It up to the community to decide if it's real or not. Reactions are added to aid in this endeavour (reaction results aren't actually recorded)

> Despite not having the question mark, it is implied. Discord command names can't have punctuation 🙄
